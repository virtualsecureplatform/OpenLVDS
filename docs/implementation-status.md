# Implementation status

The SKY130 macro implementation and reproducible build flows are present.
**The link is still in electrical bring-up and is not released.**

The latest completed checks on 2026-10-28 include:

- RTL: 1,186,812 bits across 27 clock/duty/skew cases, plus DLL control and PHY assembly.
- Schematic electrical characterization: all 60 driver, receiver, receiver-rate,
  and DLL cases across tt/ff/ss/fs/sf at 0, 25, and 40 °C.
- Extracted driver: all 15 corners pass, including edge identity, polarity,
  amplitude, common mode, and propagation measurements.
- Extracted receiver: all 15 static corners and all 15 rate corners. The rate
  test uses 840 Mb/s, 250 mV differential input, and 100 fF output load.
- Physical checks: five analog macros and three digital macros pass DRC/LVS;
  the five analog extracted networks also pass an independent connectivity audit.
- Unit tests: 42 pass, including stale-evidence rejection, parallel input timing,
  link measurement boundaries, driver latency/polarity, physical port policy, and RC trace provenance.

Extracted DLL qualification and the complete full/approximate RC
comparison remain outstanding. Completed driver cases are recorded individually
under `build/analog_extracted/`. No approximate network is qualified until the
complete comparison certificate passes. Each reusable reference now carries hashes
of its simulator provenance, requirements, circuit, fixture, waveform, and producer
snapshot. Unattested legacy traces cannot qualify or resume a reference. Fresh
receiver, delay-line, TX, and RX comparison pairs pass; driver and DLL pairs are
still required for a complete certificate.

An archived partial extracted DLL trace showed approximately 508 ps quarter-cycle
delay and 310 ps detector-input error. Automatically inserted clock-delay buffers
were found on the phase detector's inputs and outputs. All three digital macros
have been rebuilt without those cells and pass physical checks; the phase
detector additionally preserves direct clock and UP/DN connections. With equal
45 fF loads, its isolated extracted output pulses now reach approximately 1.82 V,
versus 1.29–1.35 V before the correction. DLL and link checks with the rebuilt
macros are in progress; the isolated pulse test is diagnostic evidence.

A short extracted link diagnostic with late parallel input changes shows payload
ordering errors. The earlier receiver clock-load problem was corrected and
checked independently.
The bench now launches parallel data according to the existing physical input
constraints. An isolated transistor-level TX diagnostic using the unqualified
approximate RC view and 80 fF output loads decodes all 64 payload bits correctly;
a subsequent 32-bit end-to-end diagnostic decodes every payload bit with valid
voltage levels, but measures approximately 35 ps setup margin against the
unchanged 200 ps requirement. That diagnostic uses a
0.9 V logic threshold: three sampled highs remain below 1.44 V at its selected
sample time, so it does not establish valid CMOS levels or output timing margin.
Short diagnostic runs use less training than
the 256-cycle PHY startup and cannot establish release performance.

The 4096-bit nominal electrical link and complete 45-case extracted regression
have not passed. The current release checker therefore reports failure. Read
`build/release/status.json` and the source-checked tables in
`build/characterization/` for machine-readable evidence. Missing results are
failures, and behavioral or diagnostic results cannot replace them.

The deliverable is a reusable macro library with RTL integration. It does not
include pads, ESD, a complete assembled PHY GDS, mismatch/yield qualification,
or a monolithic PLL/DLL/link noise simulation. Supply voltages remain fixed;
no voltage sweep is included.

The standalone phase-error response bench is available as:

```sh
./scripts/env.sh --ngspice python3 scripts/verify_phase_detector.py --extracted
```

Add `--corners` for all five process corners at 0, 25, and 40 °C. The bench
applies 0, ±50, ±150, and ±300 ps detector-input offsets at fixed supplies,
with the real DLL analog loading and a 20 fF indicator load. It checks that
the indicator stays low at small offsets and reaches a valid high for large
errors; a stuck-low flag cannot pass. It is a standalone diagnostic and does
not replace DLL acquisition or complete link qualification.
